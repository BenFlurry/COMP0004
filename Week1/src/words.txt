when you walk through a storm hold your head up high
and dont feel afraid of the dark

at the end of a storm theres a golden sky
and the sweet silver song of a lark

walk on through the wind, walk on through the rain
for your dreams be tossed and blown

walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
and youll never walk alone, youll never walk alone,

walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
and youll never walk alone, youll never walk alone
